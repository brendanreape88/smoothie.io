To create a recipe, head to the ‘/create’ path and check out the accordion menu of ingredients. Click on a category to see the full list of ingredients. Once you find what you’re looking for, enter the amount of the item you want, as well as the units of measurement (ie: cup, spoonful, oz., whole, bunch, etc.) then click “add.” You’ll see your newly added ingredient in the box above. Keep adding ingredients until you’ve constructed the perfect recipe, then give it a great name, and click “publish” to add it to the Smoothie.io database.

## Add An Ingredient To The Database:

## Customize A Smoothie:
